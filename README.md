# ComposeJS

### _a whole backend without leaving React_

Compose is a modern Firebase-alternative for React apps, featuring:

- cloud functions deployed on every save
- cloud versions of the react hooks you already ðŸ’–
  - `useState` -> `useCloudState`
  - `useReducer` -> `useCloudReducer`
- authentication & realtime web sockets built-in
- get started in seconds
- 100% serverless
- typescript bindings

## State Hooks

### `useCloudState`

Where `useState` is a variable that holds state within a React Component, `useCloudState` is a cloud variable that syncs state across all instances of the same `name` parameter â€“ for all users.

```ts
useCloudState<State>({
  name,
  initialState,
}: {
  name: string,
  initialState: State,
}) : [State | null, (State) => void]
```

`useCloudState` requires two named arguments:

- `name` (_required_) is a globally unique identifier string.
- `initialState` (_required_) is the initial value for the state; can be any JSON object.

It returns an array of two values, used to get and set the value of state:

1. The current value of the state. It is `null` while the state is loading.
2. A function to set the state across all references to the `name` parameter.

#### Example usage

### `useCloudReducer`

Like `useReducer`, `useCloudReducer` is for maintaining complex state. It allows you to supply a `reducer` function that _runs on the server_ to handle state update logic. For example, your reducer can disallow invalid or unauthenticated updates.

#### Example usage

## Users & Authentication

TODO

### `User`

TODO

### `magicLinkLogin`

Login users to your app via magic link.

```ts
export function magicLinkLogin({
  email,
  appName,
  redirectURL,
}: {
  email: string;
  appName: string;
  redirectURL?: string;
}): Promise<null>;
```

This function returns a promise that resolves when the magic login email is successfully sent. There are two ways to react to when the user successfully logs in (after clicking the magic link in their inbox):

1. `useUser: User | mull` returns a reactive state variable that will switch from `null` to the `User` on _any_ successful login
2. `magicLinkLogin2 : [Promise<null>, Promise<User>]` returns two promises, the first resolves when the email is successfully sent, and the second resolves when the user successfully logs in from _this_ magic link

#### Example usage

- TODO

### `useUser`

`useUser` is a React hook to get the current user. It either returns the current user or `null` if no user is not logged in.

```ts
useUser(): User | null
```

# FAQ

## What kind of state can I store?

You can store any JSON object.

## How much data can I store?

Each `name` shouldn't hold more than **~25,000 objects or ~4MB** because all state needs to [fit into your users' browsers](https://joshzeigler.com/technology/web-development/how-big-is-too-big-for-json).

This limitation will be lifted when we launch **`useCloudQuery`** (_coming soon_).

## How do I debug the current value of the state?

You can get the current value of the state as a `Promise` and log it:

```js
const testState = await getCloudState({ name: "test-state" });

console.log(testState);
```

You can print out all changes to cloud state from within a React component:

```js
const [testState, setTestState] = useCloudState({
  name: "test-state",
  initialState: [],
});

useEffect(() => console.log(testState), [testState]);
```

## Does it work offline?

Compose doesn't allow any offline editing. We may add a CRDT mode in the future which would enable offline edits.

# Pricing

Compose is currently free while we work on a pricing model.

## How to use

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Build `npm run build`

## File Structure

There are just two files, really:

- `index.ts`, which contains the whole library
- `shared-types.ts`, which contains all the types that are shared between the client and server

## Developing locally

You can use `npm link` if you want to test out changes to this client library in another project locally. For example, let's say we wanted to test out a change to this client library in the `@compose-run/community`repo:

1. In this repo, run `npm link`
2. In this repo, run `npm link ../@compose-run/community/node_modules/react` [^1]
3. In `@compose-run/community`, run `npm link @compose-run/client`
4. In this repo, run `npm run watch`

[1]: This step is to stop React from complain that you're "breaking the rules of hooks" by having "more than one copy of React in the same app". As described in the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react), you can fix this by running
